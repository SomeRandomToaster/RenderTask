CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findopenmp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "openmp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "openmp" with any
  of the following names:

    openmpConfig.cmake
    openmp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "openmp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "openmp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "openmp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
